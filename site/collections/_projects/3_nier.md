# Arcade mini-game from NierAutomata remade from scratch using Unity

In this project I tried to replicate the hacking mini-game in the famous game NierAutomata using the Unity game engine

I built everything from scratch, I created a simple cursor 3D model using Blender, exported it to unity, created enemies and created movement and shooting logic for them and replicated the VFX using unity's particle system and shader graph. The game was also used as CTF challenge for the AlphaCTF club event where players had to hack the time to win.
