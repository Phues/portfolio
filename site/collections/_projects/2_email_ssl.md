# Spam detection using Semi-supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

In the course of this project, we explored Natural Language Processing (NLP) to achieve reliable predictions. Our approach involved text preprocessing on the training data, along with feature extraction techniques such as the Bag of Words and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

To address the challenge of limited labeled data, we used semi-supervised learning, where we applied three different algorithms: Self-Learning, Label Spreading and Label Propagation.

## Technologies used

Scikit, NLTK, FastAPI, Streamlit, Vite

## Role

My Role in this project was training Label Propagation and Label Spreading models and comparing them, furthermore I also deployed the best model using streamlit.
