## Overview

This project is about the development of a web platform called EdGate, designed for managing projects related to the initiative "un diplôme-une startup / un diplôme-un brevet." The platform was developed to streamline the submission, approval, and follow-up processes for student projects, ensuring efficient communication between project members, mentors, and the administrative bodies, such as the incubation committee and the project jury.

The platform allows users to:

  - Submit project proposals.
  - Monitor the project’s progress.
  - Manage tasks and milestones.
  - Handle project defenses and approvals.
  - Communicate through notifications.
