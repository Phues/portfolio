## Overview 

In this project, we explored two approaches for automatic image colorization of greyscale image: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks [(cGANS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) and [DDColor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11613). For more details refer to [Github](https://github.com/Devnetly/Automatic-Image-Colorization)

## Technologies 

Pytorch, OpenCV, Pillow, Streamlit

## My Role

I created and trained the cGAN model and deployed it using streamlit.
